### Dataset Used
The dataset used for the project implementation is the IMDB 50K reviews dataset [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)


### instructions to run the project
- run the wordnetAugmentation.ipynb
  - ensure that the path to the IMDB dataset is correct
  - change the output files path to the desired file path
- the code takes approximately 4 hours to run with 16GB RAM
- the minimum amount of RAM required for running the program is 16GB


- after the wordnetIMDB.csv has been created, run the vanillaLSTM.ipynb
- then run the wordnetLSTM.ipynb
